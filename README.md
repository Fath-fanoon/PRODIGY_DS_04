Welcome to my submission for Task 4 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. In this task, I have analyzed and visualized sentiment patterns in social media data to gain insights into public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands. This analysis helps to uncover trends and understand the overall sentiment expressed in online discussions.

# DATASET

The dataset used for this task is twitter_training. This dataset contains records of reviews of people on social media.

# Tools and Libraries used

Jupyter notebook

Pandas

Numpy

Matplotlip & Seaborn for visualization

Textblob

# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

During the sentiment analysis process, I performed the following steps:

1.Data Preprocessing: Cleaned the social media text data by removing noise such as special characters, URLs, and stop words to ensure accurate sentiment analysis.

2.Sentiment Analysis: Applied NLP techniques to classify the sentiment of each text as positive, negative, or neutral.

3.Visualization: Created visualizations such as word clouds and sentiment distribution charts to showcase the overall sentiment patterns across different topics or brands.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, this sentiment analysis provided valuable insights into public opinion and attitudes toward specific topics or brands. The findings from this analysis can guide future research and strategy development in understanding consumer sentiment and behavior. 

Thank you for reviewing my submission.
